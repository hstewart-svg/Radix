# Inquiry: The Critical Thinking Lab for Auditors

## 🚀 Key Features

### 🔍 The Metadata Forensic Lab
Train auditors to look beyond the spreadsheet. Inquiry simulates file properties (Last Modified, Created By, System Source) to identify "Ghost Evidence" and retroactive control execution.

### 🧠 The Fragility Scoring Engine
Quantify the inherent risk of manual processes. Our proprietary algorithm calculates a **Process Fragility Score** based on manual touchpoints, handovers, and data integrity gaps, helping auditors build the business case for automation.

### 🛡️ Skepticism Challenge: The "Columbo" Method
Interactive branching dialogues where users navigate management excuses (e.g., "I misunderstood the request" or "The Manager was on vacation"). Learn to separate subjective intent from objective audit trails.

(NOT) ### 📱 PWA Enabled (reverted to HTML)
Designed for the modern, mobile auditor. Installable on **iPad, iPhone, and Laptop** without an App Store middleman.
